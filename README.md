# my_scripts
All my_scripts because I'm a big lazy person :)

<br>

## Prerequisites
 1. Be on linux.
 2. Git installed on your system.

## How to make them work ?
First, you need to download the script you want and make the script executable with :
<pre> chmod +x the_script.sh</pre>
Open your bashrc with this command :

```bash
    nano ~/.bashrc
```

And inside, add a line something like this (you can change the name of the alias) :
<pre>alias commit=~/path/to/the/script.sh</pre>
Don't forget to save the modification :)
